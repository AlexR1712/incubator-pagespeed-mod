Apache PageSpeed is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache TLP sponsor. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating project’s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- The code base appears to contain MPL licensed source code, this is not allowed as it’s category B. 
  This is OK if these are dependencies and not included, this needs to be double checked.
- The release contains some compiled code pulled in from dependencies.
- The release contains cryptography [6]. No export license has been obtained for this?
- Image used in tests / examples need to be double checked to verify licensing complies with ASF policy
  and replaced if/where needed. 
- There are files without the ASF headers. These need to be checked, and the ASF license headers
  needs to be added where needed.

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
